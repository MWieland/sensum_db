# A spatio-temporal building exposure database and information life-cycle management solution

## Summary
This is a prototype implementation of an information life-cycle management solution, based on a relational spatio-temporal database model. 
Two fictious application scenarios focusing on the modelling of residential building stocks and their changes during different phases of 
the disaster risk management cycle are provided to show the capabilities of the solution in the context of disaster risk management.
